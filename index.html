            <h4>
                Origami was initially part of traditional Japanese culture. It got its name from the Japanese words "Oru'' meaning "Fold" and "Kami" meaning paper. Starting from the year 1797, humans have been learning and teaching origami and by 1845, it was an internationally practiced art. Since then there have been over 150 international origami competitions resulting in countless origami artworks all around the world. Later on it would come to be known as a surprisingly effective stress buster and has even been proved to help with concentration and learning capacity.

                <br>
                <p>Cranes are powerful flyers, with some having <br> the ability to fly over the Himalayas. They <br> are often confused with herons which look similar but are otherwise unrelated. Unlike herons, cranes can fly with their necks outstretched.</p>

                <p>Butterflies taste with their feet. The Queen Alexandra's birdwing (Ornithoptera alexandrae) of Papua New Guinea is the largest butterfly which has an outspread wingspan of nearly a foot long.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Flying squirrels which actually glide, not fly, <br> come in over 40 species. They are very similar to bats which many people don't think about. The way they fly is that the have a kind of webbing stretching from their hands to their feet which they pull out to glide.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Frogs absorb water through their skin so they <br> don't need to drink any. Thye use a lot of water considering thier size and weight. This is because they are amphibians which are cold blooded. They are also covered in a slimy mucus which is also to help with staying at a good temperature.</p>
